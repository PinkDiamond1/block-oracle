The Epoch Block Oracle must ensure the freshness of Epoch Subgraph’s data at each *read* and *write* operation.

This means that it must perform a *Freshness Check* right after each query and just before broadcasting a message.

* Overview

* Freshness Check
The Epoch Subgraph is considered fresh if it has processed all relevant transactions targeting the *DataEdge* contract.

To assert that, the Oracle needs to fetch the latest block from the Protocol Chain and compare its number with the subgraph’s current block. If they diverge, then it means that the subgraph might not be fresh.

If the block distance is under a certain threshold, the Oracle scans the blocks in between to make sure they’re not relevant for the *DataEdge* contract.

** Example

In the diagram above, the chain head is at *Block 6*, but the Epoch Subgraph has only indexed up to *Block 3*. In this case, the Oracle would scan the block range =[B4:B6]= for any calls to the *DataEdge* contract.

If the block distance /(which in this case is equal to 3)/ were to be greater than a reasonable size, the freshness check could just assume that the Epoch Subgraph is not fresh without scanning any blocks.
