The Epoch Block Oracle tracks the Epoch Subgraph state using a simple state machine that has three possible phases:

* Uninitialized
The initial phase when the Oracle starts up and haven't queried the Epoch Subgraph yet.

The =Uninitialized= phase can transition to the =Valid= phase when the Oracle successfully queries the Epoch Subgraph and receives the expected data from it.

It can also transition to itself when the Epoch Subgraph is in an initial state and has not indexed any =Messages= yet, so it has no data to serve.

It will also transition to itself when any I/O errors occur on the first attempt at querying the Epoch Subgraph. This distiction from =Failed= is necessary because the latter will keep the latest known valid state.

* Valid
Used when the Epoch Subgraph has served the Block Oracle with valid data for the ongoing

It can transition to itselft when the Oracle sucessfully queries the Epoch Subgraph and receives valid data.

It will transition to =Failed= in case any errors happen while querying the Epoch Subgraph, such as I/O errors or the Epoch Subgraph presents itself in any failed state.

* Failed
Used when any kind of error happens while querying the Epoch Subgraph for its latest state.

While =Failed=, the Oracle will keep the latest known valid state obtained from the Epoch Subgraph, even on consecutive failures, when this phase transitions to itself.

The Oracle can recover from a failed phase if it successfuly queries the Epoch Subgraph. In that case it will transition to the =Valid= phase.

* Illegal Transitions
- The Oracle cannot transition back to the =Uninitialized= phase after it have reached either the =Valid= or =Failed= phases.
- =The transiton from =Uninitialized= to =Failed= is also illegal as the latter requires a snapshot of the last known Epoch Subgraph state.
